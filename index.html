        <h1>Hi, colleagues! Welcome to my blog.</h1>
        <p>
            I'm Khanh Nguyen, from Vietnam, and currently based in Seoul, Republic of Korea. This is my personal webpage, where I highlight my experiences, projects, and skills. I am open to potential future collaborations in the fields of unmanned vehicle systems and robotics.

         <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-user"></i> About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a Ph.D. candidate at Konkuk University (KU) under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3Y_yGaoAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank"> Prof. Park Hoon Cheol</a>. 
            I am expected to graduate in February 2026. 
            In 2021, I earned my master's degree in the same field, also under Prof. Park's guidance. 
            Prior to my studies at KU, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, which is the five-year joint program between France and Vietnam for training excellent engineers in Vietnam (le Programme de Formation d’Ingénieurs d’Excellence au Vietnam - PFIEV), from Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT) in 2018.
            The B.S. degree is accredited by the <a href="https://www.eqar.eu/register/agencies/agency/?id=22" target="_blank"> Commission of Engineer Diploma (or Commission des Titres d'Ingénieur - CTI)</a> in France and recognized by the European Network for Accreditation of Engineering Education (ENAEE). I also received the master's label by the <a href="" target="_blank"> EUR-ACE (European Accredited Engineer)</a> .
            I have a background in fluid dynamics and a strong interest in robotics, particularly in both areas of simulation and model fabrication. I have been focused on the locomotion of flapping wing robots in the air and tail-beating robotic models under water.
            I am also an avid learner, eager to explore the field of applied mathematics and coder. My goal is to contribute to the field of unmanned vehicle systems, and I welcome any discussions or collaborations in this research area.</p>
